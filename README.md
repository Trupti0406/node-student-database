# Student Database using NodeJS

### It is a simple project where I have created a student database using NodeJs and Express. I have created several requests to retrieve the data. The requests are created using Postman.

#### To run this project you will be needing to install the dependencies. Run the command `npm install` for the same.

## Using these endpoints you can access the project on your localhost:

#### /allStudents --->  GET request to get all the students that are present in the temporary database.
#### /student/:id ---> GET request to get a particular student's information using ID.
#### /topper ---> GET request to get the information of the student with highest GPA.
